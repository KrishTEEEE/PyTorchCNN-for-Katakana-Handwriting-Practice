# CNN for Katakana Handwriting Practice

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-blue)

**Project Description** - I have been learning Japanese on Duolingo for the past 6 months or so, and realized a problem with Duolingo's learning method: Duolingo separates language learning and handwriting: you learn your vocabulary and sentence patterns by reading, listening and placing blocks of characters, but you never have to write a character by hand. As a result, I am decent at reading Japanese characters, but if asked to write the character after hearing it, I forget a good number of them.
