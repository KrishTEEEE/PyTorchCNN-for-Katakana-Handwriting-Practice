# CNN for Katakana Handwriting Practice

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-blue)

## Background
I have been learning Japanese on Duolingo for the past 6 months or so, and realized a problem with Duolingo's learning method: **Not enough handwriting practice**. With a lot of Asian languages like Japanese, Chinese, Korean etc., their writing systems are entirely different from English, so it is necessary to put in time to learn how to write these characters. 

Yet, there is relatively less practice on writing these characters. When you learn the characters, a stronger focus is put on how you read them, with exercises like Multiple Choice or Mix-and-Match, where characters are given. These teach you how to recognize and read, but less so how to write it. As a result, I find myself being decent at reading the characters, but not very much so if I wanted to write something on blank paper.

I want **more handwriting practice**, and I want to **customize the characters I want to learn**, so that I can double down on my weak points and practice more. Which was the motivation for this project.

## Description
In this project, a custom Convolutional Neural Network architecture was defined and trained on the ETLCDB dataset (http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/) for the purposes of identifying Katakana characters for my Handwriting Practice Web App,
